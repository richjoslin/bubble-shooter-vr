IMPORTANT

In order for any of these scenes to work, you must do the following:

1. Drag a camera rig into the scene for your chosen VR system.
	For example, if using Oculus, drag in [Assets]/OVR/Prefabs/OVRCameraRig

2. Find the Shoot Controller instance in the scene, and drag the transform of the controller into the Controller Transform field.
	For example, if using Oculus Touch, drag in [Scene]/OVRCameraRig/TrackingSpace/RightHandAnchor to aim with your right hand.
	Or, if using Gear VR, drag in [Scene]/OVRCameraRig/TrackingSpace/CenterEyeAnchor to aim with your face.

NOTE: Currently, only the Touch Right Trigger is supported for shooting a bubble.
